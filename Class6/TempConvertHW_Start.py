# Class 6 HW Start

# Starting temperature in F
F = 35
# F = int( input('temp in fahrenheit: ') )

# Convert to Celsius
# (32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C
C = (F - 32) * (5/9)
# print(C)
# you have to round
# How do you round? google it

# print out exact statement
# "<F> degrees in Fahrenheit is equivalent to <C> degrees in Celsius."
print( str(F) + " degrees in Fahrenheit is equivalent to " + str(C) + " degrees in Celsisus." )
