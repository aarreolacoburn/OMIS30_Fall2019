# Ask the user for which scale they are going to start with?


# Check to make sure that the user inputted one of the aceptable values
# acceptable_user_scale_inputs = ['m','M','miles','Miles','km','KM','k','K','Kilometers','kilometers']


# If they did not, print out a statement telling them they did not do so and then quit out of the program.
# If they did, then continue with the rest of the program.


# Ask user for distance in the above scale


# Check to make sure that the user entered a valid distance.  
# acceptable_user_input = <float>


# Convert from M to KM, or KM to M
# Hint: is there a pattern you can use that means you don't have to write a lot of if/elif statements?


# Print out result
# print(<user_input> <'miles'/'kilometers'> is equivalent to <new distance rounded to 1 decimal places> in <'miles'/'kilometers'>)
# Hint: test this with google in both directions
